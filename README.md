# vector-visualition


This repo contains python code for visualising and plotting 2D vectors and animating them.
Also few operations on those vectors like calculating nirm, angle, distance, checking linear independence , calculating orthogonal vectors, etc.
Animation of normal vectors to their corresponding orthonormal vectors is also computed. Gram-schmidth process is used to calculate the same.

At last I am using streamlit to make it interactive and deploy it.
by today i.e. 20 oct 2023, its not deployed. almost everything is working good.
